          <p>This Privacy Policy was written to help you better understand how we collect, use and store your information.
            Since technology and privacy laws are always changing, we may occasionally update this policy.
            If a significant change is made, we will be sure to post a notice on our home page and in the user admin.
            If you continue to use Service Hunt after these changes are posted, you agree to the revised policy.
            By signing up for any of the services offered by Service Hunt (together, the “Services”),
            or dealing with a customer using Service Hunt Services, you are agreeing to the terms of this
            Privacy Policy and, as applicable, the Terms of Service. This policy is a legally binding
            agreement between you (and your client, employer or another entity if you are acting on their behalf) as

            “our”, “us” or “Service Hunt” or “Ruraara Tech Empire LLC”).
            If we add any new features or tools to our Services, they will also be subject to this policy.
            We will keep your Personal Information accurate, complete and up-to-date with the information that you provide to us.

            Personal Information as allowed by law, and provide you access to that information.
            When we use the term “Personal Information” in this policy, it means any information related to an identifiable
            individual, but does not include the name, title, business address, or telephone number of an employee
            of an organization.</p>
